### What I learned

In this project I learned how to make default themes and global styles using styled-components. I followed another Frontend Mentor user's code to better understand how the styled-components should look. I also used the `picture` and `source` tags for the first time here in order to change the image based on the size of the screen.

### Continued development

I plan to continue to improve my skills in styled-components and responsive design. I'm still having trouble understanding the css needed to make pages responsive, so I would like to improve there.
